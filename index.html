    <h1 class="S1">About Me</h1>
    I grew up in Washington D.C but in the year 2009 moved to Virginia where I eventually Graduated from the Heritage High-school Governors S.T.E.M academy with an advanced studies diploma with a primary focus on Modeling and Simulation, We worked with software such as Unity, Blender, GameMaker and basic text editors to produce simple HTML/CSS webpages as students. I have always been passionate about gaming from a developer perspective and the creation of the internet. In my school I created multiple simple side scroller videogames similar to mario 
    using simple puzzle based programming which also greatly inspired me to want to take a path into the world of programming.
